INTRODUCTION                                          *HelpMeIntroduction*
Have you ever found yourself staring at a blinking cursor on Vim's command
line, trying your hardest to remember what the command you're trying to
perform is?

Are you learning a new SuperCoolLanguage library but you could not really
remember that specific command and you are too tired to go through all the API
documentation to find it out?

Well, I have both of these problems and this plugin may help you too.

HelpMe! is nothing more than a tiny customizable popup menu for Vim 9.0+ that
you can fill as you want and that you can recall whenever you want.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                         *HelpMeRequirements*

HelpMe is written in Vim9script, therefore you need at least Vim 9.0.
That is pretty much all.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                     *HelpMeUsage*

Simply enter the command |:HelpMe| to open the menu, find what you're looking
for, then press q to close the menu.

That's it.

Of course, there won't be much in the menu until you add stuff to it. Use the
following .vimrc entry as an guide for customizing your own menu:
>
    g:HelpMeItems = [
        "Shortcuts:",
        "tt           toggle split terminal buffer",
        "daw          delete a word under the cursor",
        "caw          change a word under the cursor and insert",
        "di\"         delete text inside quotes (for others, change \")",
        "ci\"         change text inside quotes (for others, change \")",
        "<C-n>        enter multiple cursors mode",
        "",
        "Commands:",
        ":H           insert nicely formatted header comment (custom)",
        ]
    <

COMMANDS                                                     *HelpMeCommands*

                                                                 *:HelpMe*
:HelpMe [{file}]             Open the helpme popup menu.
                             If {file} is not specified, then the content of
                             |g:HelpMeItems| is displayed.
                             Example of file content could be the following:
                             >
                                SHOPPING LIST
                                -------------
                                Potatoes
                                Milk
                                Bananas
                                Pepperoni
                                Tomatoes
<

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                           *HelpMeConfiguration*

                                                           *g:HelpMeItems*

Default: [
    "Add items here by assigning a list to g:HelpMeItems in your .vimrc file. ",
    "See :h helpme.txt for detailed instructions.",
    "",
     ]

Message shown if {file} in |:HelpMe| is not specified.
